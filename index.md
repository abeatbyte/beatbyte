- Develop automation tests for verifing Atlas Copco products
- Verification of new software and hardware releases

### Programming Instructor – Tre (3), 2024  
- Designed and delivered an advanced course in Python, Git, Docker, Flask/FastAPI, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Responsible for lectures, mentoring, hands-on exercises, labs, and project work.

### Test Developer – Svenska Spel, 2015–2024  
- Integration testing using Gherkin/BDD for backend systems in sports, racing, poker, and betting.  
- Worked in Kubernetes/Docker environments with PostgreSQL, Kafka, and MongoDB.

### Developer – Ericsson, 2013–2015  
- C/C++ development for next-generation radio base stations using a Linux soft real-time OS.


### Integration Consultant – Kaj63 (Bolagsverket), 2011–2013
As a consultant from Kaj63, I worked on a major migration project for Bolagsverket, transitioning core business applications from legacy mainframe systems to a modern Linux-based development and production environment. My role included:

- Acting as a technical integrator and mentor, supporting teams in adopting new tools and workflows.
- Assisting with the setup and automation of build and deployment processes using Jenkins, Subversion, and bash scripting.
- Supporting the migration and adaptation of Cobol-based systems to run in the new platform.
- Providing hands-on development and scripting in Python, shell, and Linux environments, including development in Eclipse.

The assignment focused on improving maintainability and reproducibility of the system landscape during the transition to a modern software stack.

### Software Engineer – Thoreb IT Vehicle, 2010–2011
At Thoreb IT Vehicle, I worked as an embedded systems developer for vehicle-mounted onboard computers. My key responsibilities included:

- Board bring-up and low-level software development for custom embedded platforms based on Motorola processors.
- Porting and configuring U-Boot bootloaders for proprietary hardware designs.
- Integrating and adapting various vehicle-specific sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and gear system interfaces.
- Implementing firmware and hardware abstraction layers to ensure reliable data acquisition and communication within in-vehicle networks.

This role required deep hardware–software integration, real-time debugging, and strong collaboration with hardware engineers to validate new designs.


### Software Engineer – C-RAD Imaging, 2007–2010
At C-RAD Imaging, I developed low-level software for the GEMini ED flat panel detector system used in high-precision radiotherapy imaging. My primary responsibilities included: 

- Developing a custom Linux device driver to interface with the GEM-based detector hardware.
- Implementing a user-space application that utilized the driver to capture raw digital image data from the detector.
- Enabling TCP/IP socket-based streaming of image data for integration with external image processing and diagnostic systems.
- The system supported real-time imaging up to 30 fps at full resolution (1024×1024), and achieved high sensitivity at low radiation doses. The technology was based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) readout and required careful handling of synchronization, data buffering, and performance tuning for clinical use.
